## About the Project

### Overview
The project focuses on the comparative analysis of two language models for a medical chatbot:
- **BioBERT**: Excels in recognizing specific medical terminology and context.
- **LLaMA 2 13B**: Superior in generating empathetic and contextually appropriate responses.

### Built With
- Python
- PyTorch
- Transformers (Hugging Face)
- Flask

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Pip (Python package installer)

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jesuwin25/Healthcare_Assistant_using_LLaMA_2_13B.git
   cd Healthcare_Assistant_using_LLaMA_2_13B
   ```
   
2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
3. **Usage**
