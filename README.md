AI-Powered Medical Chatbot: BioBERT vs. LLaMA 2 13B Analysis
Overview
This repository hosts the implementation and comparative analysis of two advanced language models, BioBERT and LLaMA 2 13B, applied to an AI-powered medical chatbot designed to enhance healthcare information delivery. Our project aims to leverage these models to provide accurate, empathetic, and personalized user interactions in a healthcare setting.

Key Features
Comparative Analysis: Deep dive into the strengths and weaknesses of BioBERT and LLaMA 2 13B in processing biomedical text.
Multilingual Support: Ensures the chatbot can serve a diverse user base with capabilities in multiple languages.
Empathetic Interaction: Focuses on generating responses that are not only accurate but also empathetic and contextually appropriate.
